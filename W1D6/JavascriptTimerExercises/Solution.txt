4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
for using it)?

"Unobtrusive JavaScript" is an approach to writing JavaScript code that 
separates it from the content and structure of HTML and CSS.

The goal of unobtrusive JavaScript is to create web pages that can function without JavaScript 
enabled while still providing enhanced functionality when JavaScript is available.

This means that the JavaScript code should not interfere with or alter the behavior of the web page 
when JavaScript is disabled or not available
 and should not rely on any specific HTML or CSS structure or markup.
