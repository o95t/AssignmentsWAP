1. Which, if any, of the following 3 code fragments are equivalent? Explain why they are different, if
they are. Explain why they can have different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent. 


All three code fragments are functionally equivalent, meaning they produce the same result, 
which is to set the text color of all li elements to yellow.

The difference between the code fragments is the number and type of arguments passed to the 
callback function inside the each() method. 
The first code fragment has two arguments, idx and e, 
where idx is the index of the current element in the iteration and e is the DOM element itself. 
The second code fragment doesn't have any arguments, 
and the this keyword inside the callback function refers to the current DOM element. 
The third code fragment has one argument, idx, which is the index of the current element.


2. Write a jQuery expression to find all divs on a page that include an unordered list in them, and make
their text color be blue.

$("div:has(ul)").css("color", "blue");


3. Write jQuery code to append the following div element (and all of its contents) dynamically to the body
element.


$("body").append("<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>");
